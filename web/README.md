# QA Test Frontend

A React single-page application for the Library Manager system.  
It interacts with the [QA Test API](../api/README.md), which in turn connects to a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain via the deployed CCAPI.

Your task is to **find and clearly document every functional bug** you can identify in this front-end application.
